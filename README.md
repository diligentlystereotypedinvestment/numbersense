# Texas' UIL Number Sense Test Generator Code

Needs to be run through a LaTeX compiler. Texmaker is good and I think Overleaf is popular. genRunner.java is the runner file. Here is a list of problems that still need to be coded:

Approximation Problems are also incomplete

Answers to Estimation Problems may be slightly off
